# python-tetris
A Tetris game made in Python

There are three ways to run this game:
<ul>
<li>Running tetris.py with no command line arguments starts a game where the board has 20 rows and 10 columns, the
game board is redrawn every 25 ms, and a falling piece descends one row every 250 ms.</li>
<li>If 2 command line arguments are provided, the first will be interpreted as the desired number of rows, and the second as
the desired number of columns.</li>
<li> Providing 2 additional arguments for a total of 4 allows the redraw rate and the multiple of the redraw rate after which 
a falling piece descends to be configured respectively.</li>
</ul>
